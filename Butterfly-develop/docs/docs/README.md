## Context

Most people and entities - such as student groups - own physical goods that, although useful, are rarely used. These same goods may be valuable for acquaintances within their extended social circle who do not have these goods but would like to use them temporarily. Examples of physical goods include tools, appliances, musical instruments, etc.

The optimal outcome and mutual benefit would be for the entity that owns the item to lend it to the entity that needs it. However, this often does not happen because both parties are unaware of the other's situation.

In addition, a common concern in lending items is the difficulty in evaluating trust in the person or entity that will benefit from the use of that item.

Creating a common pool of resources among members of a community would be a valuable addition in connecting people in symmetrical situations and strengthening social ties, reducing unnecessary consumerism, and promoting a more united, responsible, and sustainable society.
