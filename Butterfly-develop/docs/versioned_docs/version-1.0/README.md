## Context

Most people and entities, such as student groups, own physical goods that, although useful, are **rarely** used. These same goods may be **valuable** for acquaintances within their extended social circle who do not have these goods but would like to use them **temporarily**. Examples of physical goods include tools, appliances, musical instruments, etc. The optimal outcome and **mutual** benefit would be for the entity that owns the item to lend it to the entity that needs it. However, this often does not happen because both parties are unaware of the other's situation.

In addition, a common concern in lending items is the difficulty in evaluating trust in the person or entity that will benefit from the use of that item. Creating a common pool of resources among members of a community would be a valuable addition in connecting people in symmetrical situations and strengthening social ties, reducing unnecessary consumerism, and promoting a more united, responsible, and sustainable society.

## This Project

In this project, the goal is to develop the EMPRESTA.ME platform, a system that promotes the meeting between these entities. Through a secure and decentralized distributed system for sharing goods, it is possible to establish free, democratic, and non-bureaucratic loan relationships.

The EMPRESTA.ME application should include a robust reputation system that allows a user to evaluate the reliability of any other based on their connections in the network. This system will be named VRS (Vouch Reputation System) where users evaluate each other by giving positive or negative vouches.

A user has access to the goods that exist in their community and can request them. Once the request has been made, the owner of the item can see the requested item and the individual who made the request. They can accept or reject the request depending on the reputation evaluation - a numerical value corresponding to the VRS evaluation - such as the vouches for or against the individual.
